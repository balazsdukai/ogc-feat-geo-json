== Media Types

Implementations should use `application/vnd.ogc.fg+json` as a preliminary media type until this Standard is stable to avoid confusing future implementations accessing JSON documents from draft versions of this Standard.

The media type `application/fg+json` will be registered for JSON-FG, if and once this Standard will be approved by OGC.

Since a JSON-FG document also conforms to GeoJSON, both the GeoJSON and the JSON-FG media types can be used. APIs that provide feature data that conforms to both GeoJSON and JSON-FG should declare support for both media types in the API definition to support clients that know JSON-FG and also those that only support GeoJSON.

[[application_fg_json]]
=== application/fg+json

----
Type name: application

Subtype name: fg+json

Required parameters: n/a

Optional parameters:

  "compatibility": If provided, the value "geojson" indicates that JSON-FG features 
  with a "place" member that is not 'null' will also include a GeoJSON geometry 
  in the "geometry" member (a point, line string, polygon or an aggregation of them 
  in WGS 84). If the parameter is missing, the "geometry" member of a JSON-FG feature 
  will be 'null', if the "place" member is not 'null'. For any other parameter value, 
  the behavior is unspecified.
