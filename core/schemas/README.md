OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG) - Beta Schemas

Repository: https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2023-02-24  Version 0.1.1 posted at 
            https://beta.schemas.opengis.net/json-fg/

The JSON Schemas of JSON-FG are designed to support extensions. 
JSON-FG documents that include extensions should still validate 
against the JSON-FG schema documents.

Therefore, the URI of the JSON-FG schema documents does not include 
information about the JSON-FG version.

It is the intent that future revisions will update and extend the 
JSON-FG schema documents so that the changes will not invalidate 
existing JSON-FG documents.

Since JSON-FG is still a draft, there may be good reasons for
breaking changes before version 1.0.0, but it is the goal to avoid 
this during the development.
