# Implementations

This page lists software packages that implement [draft JSON-FG proposals](../proposals).

Two types of software packages are distinguished:

* Server implementations are software products that generate JSON-FG documents.
* Client implementations are software products that read and process JSON-FG documents.

There is a column for each proposal and the value identifies the version of the proposal that has been implemented.

## Contribute

While the work on JSON-FG is in it early stages, if you have a server or client implementation of JSON-FG, we welcome a pull request to update this page to add or update an entry for the product.
