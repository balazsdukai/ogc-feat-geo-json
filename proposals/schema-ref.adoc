= Identifying the schema

Version: 0.2.0

== Overview

A schema is metadata about a JSON document that clients can use to validate the JSON document or to derive additional information about the content of the JSON document, e.g. a textual description of the feature properties or their value range.

The OGC Features API Standards Working Group is working on a [specification in the OGC API Features series](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/tree/master/proposals/schemas) for using JSON schemas to describe the schema of features. 

This proposal provides guidance on how to include information about the schema of a JSON document that is a single feature or a feature collection.

== Description

The JSON Schema spec https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.9.5[recommends to use a `describedby` link relation to the schema]:

> It is RECOMMENDED that instances described by a schema provide a link to a downloadable JSON Schema using the link relation "describedby", as defined by Linked Data Protocol 1.0, section 8.1.

OGC API Features already specifies a general "links" member with an array of link objects based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288[RFC 8288 (Web linking)] and feature responses from APIs implementing OGC API Features will already include a "links" member. The proposal is to build on this approach and include a "describedby" link to a JSON Schema document in the "links" array, if schema information is important for the target users of the JSON feature documents. 

.Link properties
[cols="20,10,70",options="header"]
!===
|Property |Type |Description
|href |URI |**REQUIRED**. The URI of a JSON Schema document that describes the JSON document that is the link context.
|rel |String |**REQUIRED**. The link relation type, which is always "describedby" for the link to the JSON Schema document.
|type |String |**REQUIRED**. To indicate that the target of the link is a JSON Schema document, set the value to "application/schema+json".
|title |String |Include this link attribute for a human readable label of the link, e.g. for use in a derived HTML representation.
!===

An example of a link object:

[source,json]
----
{
  "href": "https://demo.ldproxy.net/zoomstack/collections/airports/schema",
  "rel": "describedby",
  "type": "application/schema+json",
  "title": "JSON Schema of this document"
}
----

Additional link attributes may be added to the Link object.

Each JSON-FG document is either a feature or a feature collection. 

A feature collection document must contain a link to the JSON-FG feature collection schema at `TODO`. If the document is also a GeoJSON feature collection, it must contain a link to the GeoJSON feature collection schema at `https://geojson.org/schema/FeatureCollection.json`. The document should also contain another link to a schema document that specifies the properties of the features in the collection.

A feature document must contain a link to the JSON-FG feature schema at `TODO`. If the document is also a GeoJSON feature, it must contain a link to the GeoJSON feature schema at `https://geojson.org/schema/Feature.json`. The document should also contain another link to a schema document that specifies the properties of the feature.

== Discussion, Alternatives, References

1. Some environments use a "$schema" member to reference the schema of a JSON document. However, that is not the approach recommended by the JSON Schema specification itself. In JSON Schema, the value of a "$schema" property is always the URI of a meta-schema.

2. The OGC API specification for feature schemas should support at least the following two types of schemas so that they can be referenced from JSON documents retrieved from an API:
  - the schema of a feature, and
  - the schema of a feature collection, which is basically a FeatureCollection object that references the feature schema.

3. The current approach to signal to clients that the instance conforms to GeoJSON and/or JSON-FG is to link to the respective schemas. See the discussion in issue https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json/issues/10[#10]. There are at least two potential issues that should be investigated:

  - The GeoJSON schemas are in draft 07 and not available in the more recent versions 2019-09 or 2020-12. Many parsers seem to have issues mixed schema versions. However, that is less of an issue, if the GeoJSON schemas, the JSON-FG schemas and the API-specific or community schemas are referenced separately and do not reference each other. It will still be an issue, if the schema of a particular feature type wants to reference, for example, the GeoJSON Point schema to constrain the geometries to points.
  - The status and persistence of the GeoJSON schemas is unclear.

+
If we want to move forward in the current direction, we should contact the GeoJSON maintainers to discuss these topics.

4. The JSON-FG schema documents need to be set up.
