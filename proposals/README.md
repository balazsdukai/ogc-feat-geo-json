# Proposals

This folder contains proposals for building blocks of OGC Features and Geometries JSON for discussion before content is eventually moved to the specification document.

Current proposals:

* [Encoding the temporal extent of a feature](temporal-extent.adoc)
* [Identifying the schema](schema-ref.adoc)

Every proposal should be a single AsciiDoc page based on [TEMPLATE.adoc](Template.adoc).
