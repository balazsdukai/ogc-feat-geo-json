## Current proposals

Current proposals:

* [Circular geometry objects](circular-geometry-objects.adoc) - issue [#35](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json/issues/35)

## Adding a new proposal

* Every proposal should be a single AsciiDoc page based on [TEMPLATE.adoc](Template.adoc). The initial version should be 0.1.0. Add the document in the proposal folder and add a link to the proposal in this README page. This can be in a pull request or as a direct commit to the main branch.
* Create an issue for the proposal and add a link to it. This issue is a notice about the new proposal and can be used by anyone to add comments on a proposal.

## Updating a proposal

* Update the document. Increase the version number.
* Use a pull request. If the changes were already agreed in a meeting or the change is a bugfix, the pull request may be merged directly. Otherwise the pull request will be discussed and merged during a SWG meeting.
